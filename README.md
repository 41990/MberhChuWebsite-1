# A code base for the MberhChu Int Co.LTD website.
- This code is made up of three frameworks - ****`HTML`, `JavaScript` ofcourse and raw `PHP`.****
- I used [Bootstrap v5.3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) and traditional ****`CSS` including `Sass CSS` for most of the styling.****
- ****`VS Code`**** is my favorite code editor because of it's added **`extensions`** aiding much often in platform code type **`autocompletion`**.
- However, I couldn't take advantage of VS Code's **`Live Saver`**, given that it has issues making requests to **`PHP files`**.
- Feel free to comment and interact with the code, and your critics are also welcomed.
